Human,"She was ticked off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She could n't help it. She 'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She 'd gotten her certifications, and she was commander on all her flights from now on. Whenever she had two more takeoffs than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she was n't coming back this time because she 'd left something undone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flaps after takeoff. Well, if she had taken off but had n't landed the damn plane at all, she had left something undone. Naturally that causes anxiety. But as commander, she could take the yoke herself, anytime she wanted. Just to be sure, she told herself, she would make a point of landing 20 of 30 more times in the next year than she took off. And no more anxieties about being two landings down.","[4.333333333333333, 3.0, 2.0, 3.3333333333333335, 3.0]","[3.366586923599243, 2.1765284538269043, 2.3738057613372803, 2.909632921218872, 2.6429758071899414]"

The footsteps were low and stopped, slightly moving. They were both wearing typical blouses. Nice and crisp. They were light, and to my surprise they smiled. They were both very close, with their eyes shining at me. I knew something was going to happen and there was no way I was going to give them the satisfaction.

It was *not* mine, exactly. Inside was a strange looking piece of gold. It had a lock in the center. I slowly flipped it open, and this strange golden light suddenly went out of the box. I was taken aback. There was no way this could have been real. I turned around and looked inside. It was gold. So I opened the lid, and when I pressed the handle, the box was gone. I turned around again, and looked at the box again. There were a few small holes, and the lid itself had made a rather peculiar bend on the inside. I still felt puzzled.

TD-VAE,"'When the student was finished, he looked up and smiled sheepishly at the teacher across from him. ` Good bye Professor,'said the student. The teacher bowed politely to his student, and leaving them to themselves, they walked back down the stairs and to their rooms. After dinner they dined together with their friend, who was a great deal prettier than usual. As he sat there, he heard no one eat, and not a piece of meat to be had for dinner. All he wanted was a nice nice fresh steak cooked very slowly to taste. But when he touched it with his finger to see whether it was just right or not,, the poor steak grew stiff and cold at the touch of his finger. He took out the hair, put it in his mouth, and made a pretty big croquette from it. Well, of course a small piece would hardly make much of a croquette, so when the hair returned and touched his finger, it grew even smaller and weaker. ` Suppose it grew stiff again without my help?' asked he, ` on which condition shall I let it go?' And the hairs began still growing and shrank even more slowly till there was scarcely anything left of them at all. Then the teacher summoned a fine lad with several faces, black as night, with a long beard standing right before him, his head for an oyster oyster. And he planted a small pear about the body and brought it up to the school boy. “You shall not have it if you fail so far.” cried the Oyster-Master; but the first with tears went still lower than the last. By the second try his crab ran on. By the third try his spark grew faint, and when he tried to reach the oyster his arm was twitching like thunder. Then he made a right pirouette from the shell, and got away at once. “See, my son!” cried the Oy-Master. “That means your little crab will soon wither, as little crabs do in a twinkling. Now take this crab and give it up, and save up your treasure; if the crab dies, we shall get what we want first.” With these words the oyster was prepared and laid it out, ready by the Oyster-Masters. This done, there appeared in front of the crab's shell its shell and intestine, and behold! on it was writ red a sort of mark as a wolf's fur, and that looked like blood: and the plate broke upon it and it fell down into the ocean where it could not recover itself. The crabs were gathered together together one after another and taken back to the school. They thought the signs were nothing and wondered still more than before, as how anyone could tell when a big white cloud of purple smoke will suddenly appear and be what you promised them. The next morning a brave man came to the school carrying a big salmon from a great lake that is sheltered by mountains on both sides and offers splendid fish for sale.

They put the mantle on John's front porch, and he would sit down on a cold wood chair, and say one thing: if this presents a vacation, you better watch the news! After about an hour, he thought about how the tree wasn't in a tree fight; which certainly wouldn't help that it had a high school district. He had been watching the news for the past minute, and there was the US Armed Forces joining forces with the London police force.

It's the boys again!” one of the kids had shouted. “Don't worry, I 'll make you a wish”. The man I 'd been talking to was stunning. His brown hair shone in the moonlight, he had a good smile, and had a happy smile and a smile so big I nearly forgot he had even a family. His dark eyes were blank, his skin was different than usual, he wore an old worn gray sweater and his legs were stronger than usual. He looked almost the same as a man would look at me.

RoBERTa,"This is that hope. The White House, preoccupied with their day long project ( specifically the computer system ) was looking at this new news. All the commercial headlines had been carried for five thousand hours, and it seemed almost like the last few hours had gone by by slower than expected for the first twenty minutes of this new test. It wasn't a day that nobody bothered to send us letters of apology over the phone, rather a few emails received as a thank you in person. I was nervous, but also optimistic. I had only had a few days before a crazy storm came through. Well, at least, that was an overstatement. The signals had a way of increasing the area around them at alarming levels. Hundreds of millions of dead bodies, one man, another a hundred, several thousands on the ground. It was pretty obvious they were coming to conquer all of the world. Suddenly, the ground shook. I flinched as the plume of debris poured over my head, and soon a number of people began to scream.

I just want to be me. I really did. I know I'm sick and tired of it all, but I don't mind. I don't mind spending the last year and a half of my self-worth on something important. No family, no friends, nothing really. It's all true. I'm just stuck in the old, purgatory of poverty. You see, when I moved out of the country of my birth, and decided to have my own little home in my family's bungalow in the suburbs of New York City, I decided to get a cabin and settle down a little. It took me another 5 years to realize that I have a wife, two kids and a large family, but there's nothing special about her. Nothing boring, just a house, food, and a smile. I grew up in a small town, in the big, open city, where kids weren't allowed in to the old houses because they didn't fit the mold. I never knew my life would be like this, but something about her and the fact that she would eventually disappear, I had to pick up the pieces. I guess the most amazing part of life is the freedom. Not being forced to do the things I've always wanted to do. See the next person, feel the distant glances of the conversations that went on between them, make sure there's someone who cares about me. But I don't know how I do it, and it is the absolute worst thing anyone could do. I have an amazing family, a quiet little town, beautiful summer nights, free summer weekends. I even have two children, and I'm sure they 'll be great parents. I can always count on my family for something, whatever that is. But once you leave, you can't stay here.

Human,"I stared at the newspaper at my feet. “What the heck is this ?” On the front page is a picture of my restaurant, in black and white.I pick it up and start reading the article. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ **To Make A Difference** Before all of this, I was homeless, I have enough courage to say that much. My life was a mess, I lost everything because of my addiction, my home, my friends, my dignity. The way people see me and talk to me is always a simple look, never looking me in the eyes. I smelled and look dirty with old sweaters and a unshaven beard. But everything changed when an old man in a suit, approached me with a kind hearten smile. He passed me a total of $ 1000. “Sir, this is far too much, I can not take this money .” “Keep it, you need this more then me, just promise me you do something with it, and make a difference .” And with that he walked away. I did n't know who he was, much less know his name. But that was the moment in my life, where I cried for what felt like hours, that I needed to do something, I needed to change. So I used that money to get a suit, a shave, a hotel room ( with a shower ), and a used cellphone and laptop. And here I am today, as one of the top journalist in the city. But I always wanted to do something, like what that old man showed me, help someone that needed it, and help them get what they dreamed. So over the weekend I dressed up as a homeless man, and went prowling the streets. Almost nobody cared about me when I asked for change, some even scolded me that I should get a job. But then as I was walking across what seemed to be an old, abandoned shop, the door opened. A Young man, Probably only in his 20 's, came out and gave me the widest smile I had seen all day. He invited me in and served me up a bowl of soup, free of charge. From what I observed, the paint was peeling off the wall of the place, the place could barely feet 20 people, and nobody else was working there except for him. He talked to me and asked me how well I am holding up out there. I was amazed at his generosity, and that smile on his face never fazed. But when I asked him about his place, His face saddened a little. “My dream was always to start a restaurant, But both my parents disagreed. When I decided I was not going to go to college, and instead focus on my business, they kicked me out .” he sadly said. He said he barely had enough to buy this place and rent a small one room flat. “But I had few to almost zero customers, I know I 'm no five star restaurant cook, but I know how to cook a mean grilled steak .” he laughed silently at himself. But he said that was n't enough, he had nobody sending in work resumes, no customers, and his bills on everything was already in the red. “Owning a restaurant is all I ever dream about, but the way things are now, I know I 'm going to fail, but I just want to be at least given a chance, you know? To show this world what I 'm made of, and make a difference .” I thank him for the meal, and walked out of the place, before he could see any of the tears on my face. And so you have it people, an honest man just trying to keep his dream alive. And I 'm going to make that dream happen, I 'm going to be going to that restaurant for breakfast today as well as a signing event, I hope as many people can make it, cause I 'm not gon na lie, that soup was n't half bad.

My phone also started buzzing with what I assumed was people applying for jobs right now.

GPT-2 (tag),"This is kind of what I write in a post. Yes, of course I'm aware of the limitations and limitations of humanity, as I have claimed to be a beacon of great goodness throughout the ages. At least, as far as human beings are concerned. So long as I can take care of my natural condition, I can effectively force those who are suffering to the cause. It's not like I'm trying to give them the cause, just to force them to show up and claim my existence, but it's the only way to help them. The very act of granting someone's life is not a simple one. There are no stipulations of our punishments, there is no physical punishment. You're free to die your mortal life, regardless of whether your body produces the physical or physical penalty of eternal suffering. But what does that have to do with anything? As I am sure you can imagine, it's quite pleasant seeing my brethren. Though the life I've come to lead consists entirely of so much suffering, it's not that I think it's bad. It's just that it's been very hard to do so, if it were possible to do so in such a finite amount of time. I'm sure there is a certain part of you that we've found joy in and always wanted to help. The kind of happiness that is only found when the guilty have already shown themselves to be guilty. I've realized though, that even a punishment like this wouldn't be so hard if there were none.

Human,"The lone predator, the silent assassin, I felt invincible last night, but what had started out as a routine hunting expedition turned out to be a much more dangerous affair. Creeping through the tall grass of the wilderness, I listened and watched. Spring had just begun, which meant there would be sweet, succulent younglings; but they would be faithfully guarded by their mothers or families. All around me, the sounds of life filled the moonless night. Were I inclined to show the weakness that is emotion, I would have purred gleefully at all of the prospects around me. That night I would feast like the king I was! Oh so many choices before me! Was I hungry for squirrel, pigeon, or maybe even bat? Maybe I would have one of each! The air tingled with activity. How to choose my first meal? And like a sign from the heavens, my eyes fastened upon it. High in a nearby birch tree sat a sparrow 's nest, and three helpless sparrow chicks. Wonderful, marvelous, nestlings, still too small to do anything but squawk—and the mother was nowhere to be seen! I had truly hit the jackpot. I crossed the vast field between myself and tree in total silence, my ears low and tail swishing rhythmically. My claws sank into the bark of the birch tree as I carefully scaled the trunk, making sure to stay on the far side from where the nest perched. The higher I climbed, the more my ears swiveled, listening closely for the telltale chirps of the mother swallow. As a mighty warrior, I knew I must never be caught unawares. Reaching the branch on which my prey sat, I checked my surroundings once again. Still I saw, heard, and smelled no sign of the mother. This was too good to be true! Being a feline, my balance was second to none as I crept along the branch. I kept low and close to my tightrope, inching forward. This was the pivotal moment when I would either emerge the victorious hunter, or be forced to abandon my mission. The nestlings loomed larger in my superior vision. So close was I now that I could smell their youth. It was a mouth-watering sensation. Finally I was close enough, and still the helpless meals had no idea I was upon them. My muscles tended as I scrunched down for the kill strike. Like a bolt of grey lightning, I launched through the air and onto the nest, my razor-sharp teeth catching a chick by the throat. My leap had knocked one of the other chicks from the nest to its doom—a two-for-one special! As I turned to carry my prize down the birch, the fur along my back raised in alarm. I could smell her very close to my. With a deafening cry, the mother sparrow came swooping down from the branches above me. *Looks like I 'm ordering to-go, * I quipped to myself, proud of my amazing wit. If I had been a bolt of lighting before, I was now just an indiscernible streak of grey now. My trusty claws propelled my across the branch and back down the trunk in mere seconds. Mother sparrow had missed her first strike, but was circling around to come at me again. I zoomed past the other nestling as I ran for the safety of my mansion, giving the second meal a forlorn glance. No seconds tonight, it seemed. The tall grass around me rustled as the sparrow made agonizingly close dives toward me. My safety was in sight! Only a couple more yards to go. Locked tight in my jaws, the nestling fought weakly to get free, life draining quickly from the pitiful bird. I was alive with energy, swerving through the field with ease. My legs pulsed with strength. I would be dining soon. Within feet of my home, the sparrow landed a lucky blow on my back. I rolled to the side, the bird 's momentum pushing me off course. Quickly I sprang to my feet, baby sparrow still in my possession. The mother was coming back in for another blow, and I did n't have anywhere to flee. Reluctantly, I spat the chick out and rolled onto my back just as the adult sparrow was on me. She and I fought claw to talon, rolling around the grass arena. The fiesta sparrow landed several good gashes on my stomach and sides, but ultimately my four deadly paws and a clean bite to the neck silenced my attacker. I flipped back onto my feet, refusing to show any sign that my injuries were painful. In the end, I had won not one, not two, but three meals that night. Proudly striding through the push-door to my mansion, I carried the mother sparrow now in my jaws. This would make a fine gift for my servant. She had always served me well, so she deserved the largest prize. I hopped onto her bed, and happily dropped","[5.0, 4.333333333333333, 4.666666666666667, 5.0, 5.0]","[3.5986950397491455, 2.3145620822906494, 2.493208885192871, 2.8876399993896484, 3.166229724884033]"

Human,"Jackson had been a soldier in the 15 years war of China back in 2225, and he had seen atrocities. Atrocities was a good word for his experiences there, he felt. Short, and simple. He liked that, because it made a hellish nightmare easy to grasp in his mind. He had seen atrocities. When he returned to the Fractured States after the American, and West European victory over China, job opportunities were scarce, to put it in simple terms. The war had damaged Jackson in a fundamental way. Physically, he was fine. He had come back unharmed, save a few small scars he 'd picked up sharpening his Bowie knife. His mind though, had been fractured worse than the United States had been when the Chinese launched the unexpected nuclear missiles that began the 15 Years War of China. When a man in a fine suit came, and offered him a job as a guard in a mining camp on a far off planet he could hardly refuse. Not because the pay was good, it was, but because life on Earth was frightening. He 'd seen what men could do to each other, and that fear would never leave, no matter where he went on Earth. The fine suited man offered him a job on that lush green planet that sat almost cozily on the boarder of the Milky Way. The life provided there offered him a feeling of security, and safety he had not felt in months since returning home. On this planet he could have a sense of security knowing that the total population was roughly 500 humans, mining the planet 's metal resources, and security staff guarding the miners from the planet 's local inhabitants. With a population like that there was n't a chance of mass war extinction. Jackson had never left the Earth 's lovely, life giving atmosphere before so the experience of leaving on a rocket was thrilling for him, and even, oddly enough, made him relax for the duration of the ride to his new home for the next decade. Leaving the planet he was born on had been an experience that he did n't expect to be topped, at least not soon. What he found on his new home shattered his previous exhilaration. Jackson had been on his new planet one week. One week to learn the layout of the bases, mine locations, and being briefed on the local life forms. At the end of that first week, he was introduced to the specimen research facility located 35 miles from where he landed, and another 43 miles further away from the mining operations. That was where he encountered the *thing* that would bring him a new thrill. It sat in a cell with steel bars across the front that were thicker than Jackson 's torso was. It sat with its arms pulled behind its back cuffed at the wrists, what Jackson presumed would be its elbows, and finally a chain around its neck that wrapped the upper portion of its arms. It was shockingly human in its general body structure. Single head, a torso with two arms that looked almost cartoonishly muscular, as were the neck and chest of this creature. The arms were long like a gorilla 's and it had short, stocky legs. It did n't look like a runner. It stood ramrod straight as soon as Jackson entered the cell hall and saw him. The human symmetry was were the similarities ended though. While humans were anywhere from a pale white to a dark brown this thing was red, almost like a fruit with patterns that changed shades of red all over its body. “That there mother is our prized specimen ,” began Captain Cage, Jackson 's supervisor. Captain Cage continued “We have him chained like that because when we first brought him in he broke the original chains we had on him and damn near broke out his cell. He mangled one of our recruits that got too close to the cell bars while he was rampaging. After that little display we thickened his cell bars, and gave him extra chains, courtesy of upper management .” Jackson responded with a simple murmur. He was n't much for talk. “I call him Rattles ,” Captain Cage said, almost affectionately. “He likes to become active at night and rattle in his cell, and keep us all up at night .” Silence fell over the two men as they observed Rattles, and Rattles in turn observed them. Jackson had taken a disliking to Rattles within seconds of seeing it when he walked in, and after another moment of silent observation he realized why. “Rattles is intelligent, is n't he ?” Jackson marveled. “More than intelligent. He 's god damned cunning. After we upped his security he spent four days just laying in a corner ignoring his food. We thought he had expired in captivity, but when we sent guys in to collect the specimen, the moment he heard the lock click he jumped up, and flayed Anderson 's arm.

I knew where I was, and I knew this place. This was where we've been facing the overwhelming odds, when they knocked down none of the South Americans left in the West. When they pulled out from the 5th, line 8 kind to regroup. They had been at battle in the 10th to 2th prepared to defend us from the Shadow People, for all there had been was too much on our side. We thought a single dete or two fell to our fist or faceless invaders because they underestimated us. But, they did. How could we have underestimated them? They had struck back back with a Rock-Flow at over 7k the higher than their 2rd, men used to be on their side at high and safe, and then our innocents. We were as surprised as the first, 5.

I take a ticket, rip it in half, put it in my pocket. “Are you closing? I still have four tickets !” “Yeah, last ride.

Human,"He looked out from the veranda, now his veranda, with a shameful, sinking pride, the sort of pride that could turn a man into the very monster he had just defeated. He leaned on the railing and let out a heavy sigh. Abraham, the oldest slave on the lot, hobbled over and clasped his hand over Homer 's, looking through him. The weight of his gleaming gaze forced Homer to meet his eyes. Abraham drew in deeply, as though he were about to speak, his brow furrowing over his powerful eyes, which were circumscribed with wrinkles. He exhaled deeply and quickly, an unsatisfying response. Homer could not detect the sentiment buried under the man 's expressions. “What would you have had me do? They killed her .” He slumped down on the railing further and began to quiver, despite the hot Alabama sun that stared overhead. Anguished cries lept muffled from the hotbox in the yard and lingered in the heavy air, droning on like a mosquito. “I pass no judgement ,” Abraham said lowly. “Today is something you will think about every other day, for the rest of your life, whether good or bad. I have no right to interfere further .” Homer let out an involuntary laugh, “You have every right. Your life is no longer what it was. Soon they will figure it out. Word will reach town, and then what? Me, I 'll try to find my daughter. It 's what she would have done .” He paused, waiting for a response that would indicate any sense of future for the old man. “Son, I 'm not going anywhere ,” Abraham replied, stepping back from the porch to ease himself into the cushioned rocker, “You know as well as I do there 's no place to go. Not for me .” He tipped his fraying straw hat and took a sip from the sweating glass on the table beside him. The sound of hoof beats pounded in the distance. “Well, I guess that 's that, then ,” Abraham quietly observed. “You 'd better be on your way, now .” Homer twisted the wood beneath his hand in desperate frustration. His heart overtook the hoof beats, and blood pounded in his ear. He knew he was right.

TD-VAE,"' ` What a pleasure, to say the least!' said his bridegroom who seemed rather astonished at this manner of giving, though he was not altogether deaf to cries and groans from his slaves, who kept up the order. He thought that perhaps with so many wives it might have been the means of a few, but she had as many children as ever before, and they gave them as much milk as they wanted as soon as he came in. At first they were very angry at this, but everything changed to talk and exchange, and a mother began to see how curious it was when on one occasion her baby-boy had an idea of what should be done for bread and cheese, and this she did after he reached a little distance from them. Then they cut long cuts into a big pot. And as the boy hadn't cut near enough the big hole, or else they would have split it open, and have lost everything, and lived quite justly till they returned to their own family; for otherwise they would say, ` We did well, we found new husbands.' And then there comes a time when all children become spoiled enough to know that their parents don't deserve them. If their father wants something back it is quite easy for him to make his slaves go to the butcher and cut some pieces of meat into small bits, and when he gets what they want the next morning he sends them off with some message to tell their new husbands, ` You shall never be given anything.' One day the new wife and son passed through the town on their way home to their home in another part of Greece. The sons made an offer to sell their virginity to be married to the most beautiful women, while the daughter refused, but neither of them would much care about going back, for she was tired and could not think of much to see in Greece. They turned from their home at nightfall, and looking out from one window they saw a dog leading a horse along the road, carrying among it some precious money, one foot beneath his thong. The son wondered, and offered to give it back to the dog, who, having taken off its coat, put it on his back as fast as he could, and left the house. As they always promised, after a few days some fine pieces of gold were brought down to the thinnest point in a cave where the dogs could never find it again. In, or near by, there stood a heap of stones and toots of cattle, and there were millions more in it; but there was no way to get to it. Soon the father remembered what he had said, and he remembered his promise. With a stroke of the wand he opened up the caves in every direction, and which didn t seem the proper place to ask the luckiest and holiest young man to bring his jewels. His eyes grew sad as he listened to the strange noises that were heard through such holes, and he feared what would happen when the slave took away the jewels. Well, he hung up his jewels in a box and went in. When he entered the hall there was so loud music that all the windows in the palace burst through, and so great a noise of trumpets and clangs that his bridegrooms fancied they saw torches marching in front of the gate. His parents were trying to stop him, but every woman in the court threw herself on him, crying out: ` There is your treasure, my lovely son. Look! golden tresses shall fall in a heap at once!' For a moment the judge wondered what made her cry like that, and wondering what could explain it, so he shook her gently and went on. Suddenly, walking towards her, the child clasped his hands tight together: ` You may not take anything away, love.' She cried with tears flowing down her cheeks: ` Come! tell me what you mean!' The judge turned away, looking with an ugly face, and presently went up to a spot where he saw the treasure lying crushed into dust. At this sight his eyes sunk into his beard, and, which the king looked down again and stared down. ` My dear son,'Good heavens,'he cried; I have plenty!'m a brother there was there, your good quality for my valentress!'He will see all three slaps and all to bring me.'

Human,"**Prelude: ** “Brujeria ,” they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. “The one you seek is Brujeria. “Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit .” Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca was n't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. Agueda did n't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. “It tastes good, yes ?” A voice said behind her. She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish was n't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. “No use for me now. You take it, you finish it .” Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish 's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. “I 'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry ... .” “The spirits told me ,” the Brujeria said, interrupting. “And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought .” As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. “Yes, I do .” Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone. “Again, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this .” Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. “I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child ,” said the old woman. “The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own .” Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe?

Then he curled his scarlet beard which was growing rather bushy, and said ` Dear Hunter ', for he knew that unless the fight with the monsters was long enough, he would be turned to stone.' And when the princess saw him she thought that if he only found a sword and rode away on it, he might not get killed.' So the hunter sat down again with a great wine cup, put on some stony armour, and rode away as fast as possible. He reached the place where the monsters were standing, but they had just struck at him and then returned with the sword, so that he looked about him no more, but even took off part of his shirt to hide the mark he had made. When he got near the other side of the valley he rode slowly to the edge of the cliff. ` Where is the monster?' asked the horse that lay behind him; but the moment the sword came round to its target, the beast sprang out and carried off the rider. The queen was frightened when she heard of it, and throwing herself on her knees, saved that prince's life for a little while. At last she came up to a tree, by the roots torn up by the monster, when the lightning ran so high and bright that all else melted away.' Ah! what dreadful thing was that? And who was at it?' cried ` We are only servants'; and the beggar gave her some water till she recovered from her shock; and she looked round and saw the mountain where the only two men remained alive in the fight. She rushed towards them, where all four were dead, except that the giantess was crouching weeping, and that maidens just like their sisters bore them tresspipes on the back and neck.

Then they set out to search for a ship that carried them far away in a night.

They were trying to follow this boat now, but every day they had to stay nearer to the coast, and at the end of the week there was a fine storm; they were all dirty and hungry in the moonlight, and wept bitterly from their disappointment and thirst, and the poor maidens were instead thinking how difficult it was to manage even to walk on the grass among all the corn and sago plants with the woolen stockings dangling upon their head like cords.

But the horses galloped past the island on which they sat eating potatoes.'

Just then the head of the little fish cried: ` You have caught my little sister's lute, but I will no longer wager her as you set me free.' ` That is what I did not mean to do,'answered the old dwarf again. ` Now draw me off by a rope from the top of the tower and throw me down a well. I will bid the elder of us good evening, on behalf of my child, who was as happy as anyone else at home when she died. If she was not happy enough, it was your fault, for I knew that neither sun nor moon stood still with her.” I hardly know what to say.' ` And you?' cried the girl, throwing back her silken veil; ` had it not been for those roots that I was left hanging?' The younger dwarf did not answer, for he wished that nothing should be said about him. ` It must be true! But it is an idle story to talk of my life,'said he; and he picked up the sword again and made haste to reach the top of the tower. Before his feet touched it he did not wish to look back so soon -- he only wished that he might have only himself to begin with. Before long he found there a fountain watering the river, on which a thousand heads sang and no one lived. When the hero reached the place he looked through the shining window and saw two figures standing stark and firm in the water. The bronze head looked like a lake, and the silvery one was almost as big as a sun. If he had seen those two before he would never have thought that they were as beautiful as they seemed, for the other looked as if she felt at ease in the depths of the fountain. He clasped the water and ran quickly towards the fountain. His hand soon caught in the bronze one; suddenly he sank to the bottom. For two miles round and round he ran until he came up in the land of darkness where spiders and men thrashed about him, so that everyone he met wanted only to bite him. The creature became stiller when he got within sight of a vast river, each night glittering like a chasm; but always he saw the gold ornaments that dwelt among the rocks in their caves. ` Was that a boat?' asked he to himself with amazement. ` No,'said the girl again, ` the bed I strewed was a great deal bigger than this one.' And in spite of everything he heard the head peep out.' I know what you mean.' ` But, my dear,'replied the dwarf,'I have sworn I shall not marry anyone till I have saved you from drowning.” I never heard so much of drowning'; but the princess loved him, not because she believed him, though she really was sure of that, but because she loved his kindness and his prudence, and because she loved him for his cleverness. ` Well,'said the head softly, stopping suddenly in front of the river and gazing at the young dwarf.","[3.3333333333333335, 2.6666666666666665, 2.3333333333333335, 3.6666666666666665, 3.3333333333333335]","[3.581181526184082, 2.2872161865234375, 2.6030027866363525, 3.2797083854675293, 2.9467267990112305]"

GPT-2 (tag),"My soulmate was born with golden skin, well-kept hair, but we both saw the first day she became mine. For years we made love with each other, but there was always a tug in the back of our minds. Could we be with each other? Once we moved to a new city, we had a friendly chat, and the next day we moved back to Florida, to start our careers. Two years before, I fell in love with my reflection. It happened so fast. She and I had been in a car crash, and I saw her in the mirror. She looked amazing in all her glory. The black hair bounced around her face and she hugged me as tight as she could, only to laugh as tears fell from her eyes. She cried a lot, and I cried a lot, but I could still hear her voice. I watched her once more as she laughed at herself. I knew something was wrong, but I never did know what to do. “Hey, you!” She called. “Oh, look at that.” “What?” I said. “My reflection.” She said. “Oh. That was so easy.” I said. We were finally happy. It's funny how it all came to a head when we realized she was the only one who could ever really love me. We were finally happy.","[3.6666666666666665, 3.0, 2.0, 3.6666666666666665, 3.3333333333333335]","[3.202902317047119, 2.489865303039551, 2.069819211959839, 2.5003933906555176, 2.1958119869232178]"

RoBERTa,"As usual the cats were going through most of the last process of making the most brilliant plans. One old goat fell through, all the feline present had fallen through the potholes. I ran over to him. He was an asshole. But I didn't give a shit. I grabbed the least human alive. I tied him to a tree, packed my whole breakfast and drove off. I ran after Freddy Krueger, one way or another, I needed to keep walking for a little while. As I ran into the street, I threw a switch and the faint smell of baked onion suddenly filled my nostrils. As I ran across the street towards him, I saw it. I saw it almost instantly, it was a light switch. I reached the switch and my hand went black, as did my life. It shattered and splintered, my whole chest lightening, I was saved. I guess I had been a fool of a man.","[3.3333333333333335, 1.0, 2.0, 2.3333333333333335, 2.3333333333333335]","[3.101882219314575, 2.555373191833496, 2.3840761184692383, 2.6051673889160156, 2.789001941680908]"
